# Innovative tobacco substitutes help you smoke in a less harmful way

<p>Over the past decades, manufacturers in the tobacco industry have been committed to developing innovative tobacco substitutes to reduce the harm of cigarette smoking.</p>
<p>Some popular smoking substitutes include electronic cigarettes, nicotine pouches, smokeless products, and so on.</p>
<p>By eliminating the burning process of tobacco that produces toxins and carcinogens, these products are considered to provide people with a less harmful way to satisfy a nicotine craving than traditional cigarettes.</p>
<p>One problem with these products, however, is that they can't provide smokers with the feeling of being close to smoking. As a result, some smokers may find that it is not easy for them to make a smooth transition.</p>
<p>It is gratifying that in recent years, the next-generation product category - heat-not-burn products have solved this problem.</p>
<p>Like many other tobacco substitutes on the market, heat-not-burn products aim to provide a safer tobacco substitute for conventional cigarettes.</p>
<p>What distinguishes them from other tobacco substitutes is that they allow smokers to keep smoking habits and sensations. This means that people feel like smoking traditional cigarettes when they consume heat-not-burn products.</p>
<p>Let's dive into this innovative product category and see whether it is the best substitute for smoking.</p>
<p><strong>Heat-not-burn products vs. conventional cigarettes</strong></p>
<p>As we all know, traditional cigarettes are ignited and burned to an extremely high temperature of up to 900&deg;C, producing smoke containing nicotine for smokers to inhale.</p>
<p>Besides nicotine, the most typical substance in cigarette smoke, thousands of chemicals are released during cigarette burning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What's worse, among these chemicals, hundreds of compounds were found to be toxic, of which 69 were known to be carcinogenic. These poisonous chemicals will increase the risk of lung cancer, COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), heart disease, stroke, and many other chronic diseases.</p>
<p>On the contrary,heat-not-burn products do not involve fire and combustion. Instead, they use a heat-not-burn technology to heat or bake raw materials at around 350&deg;C, which is lower than the combustion level.</p>
<p>Because there is no combustion, heat-not-burn products will not produce cigarette smoke and its by-products, such as tar, ash, and carbon monoxide. In contrast, the emission of heat-not-burn products is inhalable aerosol or steam, and there are no toxins and carcinogens related to tobacco combustion.</p>
<p>Thus, compared with traditional cigarettes, heat-not-burn products expose smokers and their bystanders to lower levels of toxins, making them a safer substitute for tobacco cigarettes.</p>
<p><strong>Heated tobacco sticks: provide a smoking experience without fire and toxic smoke</strong></p>
<p>Heat-not-burn products are often referred to as heated tobacco products or tobacco heating products.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just as the name implies, heated tobacco products are based on real tobacco, which is heated without burning, releasing nicotine-filled aerosol for users to inhale.</p>
<p>Heat-not-burn heating devices are usually battery-powered handheld devices, which look similar to e-cigarette heating devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Several types of heat-not-burn heating systems are available on the market. Some use a heating blade to pierce into the stick and heat it from the inside out. Others use the heating chamber to heat the stick from the outside.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although <strong><a href="https://neafs.com/">heated tobacco</a></strong> products are fundamentally different from traditional cigarettes in their mechanism, they are close to the look, taste, nicotine satisfaction, smoking ritual, and feel of traditional cigarettes.</p>
<p>For example, heated tobacco products are usually specially designed cigarettes, which look similar to regular cigarettes but are smaller in size, so they are also called sticks or mini-cigarettes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, since heated tobacco products use real tobacco, they are nicotine-based products. The nicotine contents of heated tobacco sticks are usually equivalent to that of traditional cigarettes to help smokers overcome nicotine cravings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, heated tobacco sticks emulate smoking behaviors, such as hand-to-mouth movement, inhalation, and exhalation, which can give smokers a nostalgic feeling.</p>
<p>To put it simply, heated tobacco products make smokers feel like they are smoking regular cigarettes, thus helping them to make a natural transition.</p>
<p>Some popular brands of heated tobacco products include IQOS HEETS of PMI, Ploom EVO sticks of JT Group, and glo NEO sticks from BAT. Among them, IQOS is the most widely used, occupying more than 70% market share in the field of heated tobacco.</p>
<p>While heated tobacco sticks can reduce the level of toxins caused by tobacco burning, they are not without risk.</p>
<p>This is because heated tobacco products use actual tobacco, and the plant contains harmful compounds on its own.</p>
<p>Some toxic chemicals naturally exist in tobacco, while others are accumulated during its planting, such as heavy metals and radioactive substances. These toxic compounds can cause tobacco-related diseases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>More importantly, tobacco contains nicotine, a highly addictive substance that makes people smoke frequently. This means that heated tobacco products can be as addictive as conventional cigarettes. So, for those who want to ditch nicotine forever, heated tobacco products may not be an ideal choice.</p>
<p>But don't worry because manufacturers have taken a step further and developed tobacco-free heated sticks to help people quit tobacco and nicotine all for good.</p>
<p><strong>Non-tobacco heated sticks: an ideal choice to help you quit tobacco and nicotine</strong></p>
<p>Non-tobacco heated sticks or tobacco-free heated sticks are considered substitutes for heated tobacco or ordinary cigarettes, and they are the latest innovations in the heat-not-burn range.</p>
<p>These products share the same heating technology as heated tobacco products, that is, heating the stick instead of burning it to produce an inhalable aerosol.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, like heated tobacco sticks, tobacco-free heated sticks also resemble the appearance, smoking acts, and sensory experience of regular cigarettes, giving smokers a feeling similar to smoking regular cigarettes.</p>
<p>The essential difference between tobacco-free heated sticks and heated tobacco sticks lies in the formula.</p>
<p>Unlike heated tobacco sticks using real tobacco, tobacco-free heated sticks use tea, natural herbs, or other organic plants as the main base and are mixed with mint, vegetable glycerin, propylene glycol, and flavorings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because these products do not contain actual tobacco, they do not have the unpleasant odor or smell of tobacco products, making them taste fresher.</p>
<p>What's more, tobacco-free heated sticks are more flavorful than heated tobacco products, as they can provide a large number of flavors to choose from.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Non-tobacco heated sticks are still an emerging market, and there are only a few attempts in this field at present. Neafs, for example, is the first brand to develop non-tobacco heated sticks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Neafs was established in Orlando, Florida, in 2015, using a special blend of tea as the basic material, which is mixed with flavorings.</p>
<p>Neafs offers a variety of flavors, including menthol, blueberry, coffee, mojito, and strawberry, to meet different needs.</p>
<p>For those who are looking for the real tobacco flavor, Neafs heated sticks provide the original flavor, which is the classic Virginia tobacco flavor minus the real tobacco and its odor.</p>
<p>In short, Neafs heated sticks best suit those who intend to give up tobacco and nicotine, stay away from harmful cigarette smoke and its residues, and still want to indulge in smoking-like sensations.</p>
<p><strong>In summary</strong></p>
<p>Heat-not-burn products include heated tobacco sticks and tobacco-free heated sticks, which are designed to help people quit tobacco smoking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, these products enable people to experience something that feels like smoking a regular cigarette without inhaling a combusted tobacco cigarette, making it a new and safer approach to smoking.</p>
<p>So, if you want to quit regular cigarettes but still want to keep the smoking effect, heated tobacco sticks and tobacco-free heated sticks can be your good choices, but if you plan to stay away from tobacco and nicotine, tobacco-free heated sticks are more suitable than heated tobacco sticks.</p>
